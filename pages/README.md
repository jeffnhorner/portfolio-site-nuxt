**The framework reads all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and creates the router of your application. Thus, any new file created here will generat a new route (i.e. about.vue will create a /about route). You can also have views in this folder as well.**

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing).
